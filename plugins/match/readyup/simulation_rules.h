// Simulation mode (match config `simulation: true`, `simulation_timescale`): bots play a whole
// match or series for platform end-to-end tests. The pure logic (no engine calls; ctest
// `match_simulation`); the engine side is simulation.h.
//
// One bot per roster player (a team without a roster gets `fill` anonymous bots). A bot that joins
// takes a free roster identity of the team on its side and keeps it for the map: its stats and
// the player events use that SteamID64 and name, so the platform sees the configured roster play.
// Bots are added one at a time (`bot_join_team CT|T` + `bot_quota n`, the quota only ever goes
// up while the map runs) until every side has its bots; a missing bot is added again.

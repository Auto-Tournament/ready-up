// Internal per-player match statistics, per round and per map.
//
// Engine-free: game_events.cpp resolves engine events to player ids and sides and
// feeds a StatsAccumulator; tests/match_stats_test.cpp drives one directly. The
// transport (what is sent where, and in which shape) is designed separately; this
// file only owns the model and a JSON serializer for it (ToJson).
//
// Ids: SteamID64 for humans. game_events.cpp gives bots ids in the reserved
// dev-bot range (slot_registry.h IsDevBotId) so they can be tracked; consumers
// decide whether to show them.
// Sides: CS team numbers, 2 = T, 3 = CT. Team slots: 1 = team1, 2 = team2, 0 = unknown.
//
// Definitions:
//  - kills exclude team kills and suicides (those count in team_kills / suicides);
//    deaths always count. Suicide = attacker is the victim or the world.
//  - assists: an assist on an enemy; a flash assist counts in flash_assists instead.
//  - damage: health actually removed from enemies (capped at the victim's remaining
//    health); utility_damage: the part dealt by HE / molotov / incendiary.
//  - enemies_flashed / friendlies_flashed: player_blind with a duration > 0.
//  - entry_kills_* / entry_deaths_*: the first kill of a round (not a team kill),
//    split by the side the player was on.
//  - trade_kills: killing an enemy within 5 s of that enemy killing a teammate; the
//    teammate's death counts as traded (traded_deaths) and for KAST.
//  - kast_rounds: rounds with a kill, assist (incl. flash assist), survival or trade.
//  - clutches_won[n-1]: rounds won as the last player alive against n enemies (1..5).
//  - multi_kills[n-1]: rounds with exactly n kills (5 = five or more).
//  - rounds_played: rounds the player was on CT/T for.
//  - mvp: round_mvp awards; score: the engine scoreboard score (set by the feeder).

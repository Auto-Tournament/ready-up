// The match half of what used to be the core's game_events.cpp: engine game events
// (ru_api subscribe_game_event) -> round lifecycle (warmup -> live, halftime / overtime side
// swaps, knife round end, round_end webhooks, map-end detection), per-player stats
// (match_stats.h) and damage totals for the damage tiebreak.
//
// Timing: stats events (player_death, player_hurt, ...) are handled synchronously inside the
// engine's dispatch. round_start / round_end are copied and handled on the same frame's tick,
// after the core delivered that frame's log lines: the log-derived scores (SFUI notices) the
// round end webhook reports are then up to date, whichever order the engine logged and fired
// them in.

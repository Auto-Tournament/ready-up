# Commercial use and license keys

The free license covers noncommercial use only. If you or your organization earn money from
Ready Up (a business, a profit-making event or tournament, a paid server operator, or selling
Ready Up or a service built on it), you need a paid commercial license before you install it.
See [pricing](https://autotournament.gg/pricing) or email
[sivert@autotournament.gg](mailto:sivert@autotournament.gg). Then install with
`--accept-license=commercial --license-key ATL1...` (or answer "commercial" in the installer). The
server prints a one-line license notice at every start, and a notice when no license answer is
recorded (`readyup_license_accepted`); neither ever blocks anything.

## License key

 A paid license comes with a key (`ATL1...`). Put it in `server.cfg` (or let
[CS2 Server Manager](https://github.com/Auto-Tournament/cs2-server-manager) do it: `csm license set`
writes `cfg/readyup_license.cfg` and execs it from `server.cfg`):

```
readyup_license_key "ATL1...."
readyup_show_license 0   // 1: players see "Licensed to <licensee>" in .help and .ru version
```

Ready Up checks the key offline (Ed25519, no network) and prints one console line at load and
when the key changes, e.g. `License: Example LAN · Servers M (15 servers) · yearly, updates until
2027-10-01 · valid (license L-…)`. `ru license` (console) or `.ru license` (admins) shows it again.
The key itself is never logged. An expired update period (this build's version line came out
after `updates_until`), an event window that has ended, or an invalid key is a console warning
only, and players never see anything like "unlicensed". Without a key, the server logs one line
that it is free for non-commercial use, and nothing is ever limited.

### When a paid license stops

A monthly or yearly license is valid while it is paid. When a genuine paid key has stopped, Ready
Up refuses to load new matches (the console says why) until it is sorted; running matches are
never touched:

- not paid 14 days after the last paid day;
- the key was replaced by a new one in the console a day ago (paste the new key);
- the key is in use on another Auto Tournament install ("Move to another install" in the console).

The key never changes on renewal or more servers. CS2 Server Manager writes what it last heard
from the license server next to the key, in `readyup_license.cfg`:

```
readyup_license_lease "ATL1...."          // the license's current terms (signed, marked lease)
readyup_license_state "replaced 2026-10-11" // the license server's answer: status and stop day
```

`ru license` shows the paid license's standing.

Looking for an MIT plugin instead? [MatchZy Enhanced](https://github.com/Auto-Tournament/matchzy-enhanced) is MIT licensed and free for any use, including paid work. Ready Up is a different plugin, not a fork of it.

Third-party code under `third_party/` keeps its own license.

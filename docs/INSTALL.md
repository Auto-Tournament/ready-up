# Install

## Supported setup

Ready Up runs on Linux dedicated servers (`linuxsteamrt64`). Release builds need nothing on
the host beyond glibc 2.31+ (OpenSSL and libcurl are linked in). There is no database: admins,
persisted settings, match recovery state and skins loadouts are small JSON files in
`game/csgo/readyup/plugins/<plugin>/` (see [Data files](#data-files)).

Metamod can run alongside Ready Up. In `gameinfo.gi`, Metamod's `Game csgo/addons/metamod`
line stays first, Ready Up's `Game csgo/readyup` goes directly below it, and both stay above
`Game csgo`. With Ready Up above Metamod, Metamod never loads (and neither does anything it
loads, such as CounterStrikeSharp); Ready Up logs a `load-order: WARNING` line at startup.
We recommend running Ready Up on its own, and never next to another match plugin: see
[COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) for what was tested and what breaks.

## Install with the installer

From the server root (the folder with `game/`), as the server's user:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Auto-Tournament/ready-up/master/install.sh | bash
```

See the [README](../README.md#install) for the checklist, the non-interactive forms
(`essentials`, `full`, `--yes`, `--remove`, `--uninstall [--purge]`, `--zip`, `--version`,
`--channel`, `--dir`, `--accept-license`, `--license-key`) and what it touches. It records what is installed in
`game/csgo/readyup/installed.json` (component -> version) and each component's file list in
`game/csgo/readyup/manifests/<component>.json`, which is how updates remove files a newer
version no longer ships and how unticking a component removes it.

### License

Before it installs anything, the installer asks once:

1. **How will you use Ready Up?** `1` personal / non-commercial (free, PolyForm Noncommercial
   1.0.0) or `2` commercial (you need a license, see the [README](../README.md#commercial-use)).
   With `2` you can paste your license key (`ATL1...`) now or press enter to add it later.
2. **A short summary of the terms**, with links to the license text and pricing. Type
   `I AGREE` (any case) to continue; anything else stops without installing.

The answer is saved in `game/csgo/cfg/ReadyUp/license.cfg`:

```
readyup_license_accepted "noncommercial"        // or "commercial"
readyup_license_accepted_at "2026-09-29T10:00:00Z"
```

and a pasted key in `game/csgo/cfg/readyup_license.cfg` as `readyup_license_key "ATL1..."` (the
file `csm license set` writes; the core reads both files at startup). Updates don't ask again.
An answer saved by an older installer (`readyup/license-acceptance.json`) still counts and moves to
`license.cfg` on the next run.

Unattended installs (CI, csm, containers, `--yes`, a bundle/component name, no terminal) pass the
answer as flags; without them (and no saved answer) they stop before changing anything:

```bash
bash install.sh essentials --accept-license=noncommercial
bash install.sh essentials --accept-license=commercial --license-key ATL1...   # key optional
```

`--license-key` on its own also replaces the key on a server that already has an answer.
Removing components and uninstalling never ask.

Without a recorded answer the server prints `License terms not accepted: run the installer or set
readyup_license_accepted ...` once at startup and in `ru license`. That is a notice only: nothing
is ever blocked or limited. Servers installed by hand can set the two lines above in
`cfg/ReadyUp/license.cfg` (or any cfg the server runs).

### Beta channel (pre-releases)

Pre-releases (`vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`) are published on GitHub as pre-releases, never as
"latest". The installer's default is the latest **stable** release; pre-releases are opt-in:

```bash
curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- --channel beta           # the newest release, pre-releases included
curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- --version v0.1.0-beta.1  # exactly that release (the v is optional)
```

`--channel stable` is the default. `--channel` and `--version` don't go together. Updates follow
the flags of each run: `bash install.sh --yes` goes back to the latest stable release, so testers
keep passing `--channel beta`. While there is no stable release at all, a run without either flag
stops with a message naming `--channel beta` and the newest pre-release for `--version` (it does
not fall back to a pre-release on its own). The platform's update check reads GitHub's
`releases/latest`, so it never offers a pre-release either.

## Install from a release zip by hand

Every zip's root is the contents of `game/csgo`:

| Zip | Contents |
|---|---|
| `ready-up-essentials-<v>-linuxsteamrt64.zip` | core + essentials + match + fleet + practice (default, no skins) |
| `ready-up-full-<v>-linuxsteamrt64.zip` | core + essentials + match + fleet + practice + skins + hello + midas + whitelist + deathmatch + addons + `readyup_sigcheck` / `readyup_hookcheck` |
| `ready-up-core-...`, `-match-...`, `-fleet-...`, `-practice-...`, `-essentials-plugin-...`, `-skins-...`, `-hello-...`, `-midas-...`, `-whitelist-...`, `-deathmatch-...`, `-addons-...` | single components. The core runs alone, but the match flow (ready-up, knife, pauses, webhooks) is `match`. `fleet` links the server to the Auto Tournament platform and stays idle until configured ([FLEET.md](FLEET.md)). `ready-up-essentials-plugin-...` is the essentials plugin alone (admins, map commands); `ready-up-essentials-...` without `-plugin` is the bundle. |
| `SHA256SUMS` | checksums of every zip |

1. Extract the zip into `game/csgo`. You should end up with `game/csgo/readyup/bin/linuxsteamrt64/libserver.so`.
2. Add Ready Up to `gameinfo.gi`:

   ```bash
   cd game/csgo
   python3 readyup/tools/patch_gameinfo.py gameinfo.gi --game csgo/readyup
   ```

   If you have `gameinfo_branchspecific.gi`, run it on that file too. The patcher is
   idempotent, fixes a misplaced or duplicated entry, and writes a
   `.readyup-backup-<timestamp>` copy whenever it changes the file. `--check` only reports
   (exit 3 = needs patching); `--remove` takes the line out again.
3. Copy `readyup/bin/linuxsteamrt64/readyup.cfg.example` to `readyup.cfg` next to it and
   `readyup/cfg-templates/ReadyUp/*.cfg` to `game/csgo/cfg/ReadyUp/` if you don't have them yet.
4. Restart the server.

CS2 updates rewrite `gameinfo.gi`, so run the patcher (or the installer) again after each one.

The zips only contain files Ready Up owns, so extracting a newer one over an install keeps
your `readyup.cfg`, `cfg/` edits and the plugins' JSON data:

- `readyup/bin/linuxsteamrt64/libserver.so` (the core)
- `readyup/bin/linuxsteamrt64/engine-surface.json` (signatures + identity anchors, also embedded in the core)
- `readyup/bin/linuxsteamrt64/readyup.cfg.example`
- `readyup/tools/patch_gameinfo.py`, `readyup/tools/install.sh`,
  `readyup/tools/migrate-postgres-to-json.py`
- `readyup/cfg-templates/ReadyUp/*.cfg` (mode cfgs, only used when cfg exec is enabled)
- `readyup/VERSION`, `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `LICENSE`, `BUILD_INFO` (commit + the CS2 build it was verified against)
- skins only: `readyup/plugins/skins.so`, `readyup/bin/linuxsteamrt64/engine-surface.skins.json`, `readyup/SKINS-WARNING.txt`
- fleet only: `readyup/plugins/fleet.so`, `readyup/cfg-templates/ReadyUp/fleet.cfg` (copied to
  `cfg/ReadyUp/fleet.cfg` if missing; every line is commented out, so the link stays idle until
  you set `url` and an enrollment code or key). Its data dir `readyup/plugins/fleet/`
  (`install_id`, `credentials.json`, spool) is never shipped and survives updates and removal.
- hello only: `readyup/plugins/hello.so`
- `readyup/manifests/<component>.json`

## Data files

Ready Up keeps its state in small JSON files, one directory per plugin. Every file has a
`"version"`, is replaced atomically (temp file + rename) and is never shipped in a zip, so
updates keep it. A file that is broken or from a newer version is moved to
`<name>.corrupt-<time>`, logged, and the plugin starts fresh.

| File (under `game/csgo/readyup/plugins/`) | What | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `match/state.json` | persisted settings (`ru_webhook_url`, `ru_heartbeat_url`, `ru_match_token`, `ru_admins_url`, ...) and the crash-recovery match state | the match plugin |
| `essentials/admins.json` | standalone admins ([ADMINS.md](ADMINS.md)); copied once from the old `match/admins.json` | `ru admins add/remove`, or by hand |
| `match/fleet-admins.json` | fleet mode: cached platform admin list | the match plugin |
| `skins/loadouts.json` | standalone skins loadouts ([json-contract.md](../plugins/skins/docs/json-contract.md)) | you / a web tool / `scripts/seed-dev-skins.py` |
| `skins/stattrak.json` | standalone StatTrak counters | the skins plugin |

Back up the directory to keep admins and loadouts; delete `match/state.json` to forget persisted
settings and a half-finished match.

### Console settings that survive a restart

These match settings are saved in `match/state.json` (`"settings"`, one key per command name)
when you change them on the console, over RCON or from a cfg file, and are applied again when the
match plugin loads after a server restart:

- `ru_webhook_url`, `ru_heartbeat_url`, `ru_match_token`, `ru_admins_url`,
  `ru_admins_refresh_seconds` (`<setting> clear` forgets them)
- `ru_cfg_exec_enable`, `ru_warmup_enable`, `ru_warmup_message_html`, `ru_warmup_respawn`,
  `ru_warmup_ignore_win_conditions`, `ru_warmup_roundtime_minutes`, `ru_warmup_startmoney`,
  `ru_warmup_maxmoney`, `ru_warmup_buy_anywhere`, `ru_warmup_infinite_ammo`
- `ru_demo_recording_enabled`, `ru_demo_path`, `ru_demo_name_format`, `ru_demo_upload_url`,
  `ru_demo_upload_method`, `ru_demo_upload_attempts`, and the headers from
  `ru_demo_upload_header` (saved together as one key, `ru_demo_upload_headers`), and
  `ru_demo_upload_header_key` / `ru_demo_upload_header_value` (the platform's token header; the
  `get5_demo_upload_header_key` / `_value` aliases are saved under these names)
- `ru_series_end_kick_delay_no_demo`, `ru_series_end_kick_delay_demo_no_upload`,
  `ru_series_end_kick_delay_demo_upload`

Not saved: `ru_dev_bots_scrim` (debug only; `ru_dev_bots_scrim cfg` goes back to readyup.cfg) and
the read-only `ru_demo_status` / `ru_match_stats [matchid]` (one console line `match_stats {...}`: the
current map's stats in the round_end / map_result team shape, `plugins/match/readyup/at_payloads.h`).

How the value is chosen, lowest to highest:

1. The built-in default. None of these settings has a `readyup.cfg` key.
2. The saved value, applied when the plugin loads at server start.
3. Any later command. That includes lines in `server.cfg` or other cfg files the server runs after
   Ready Up loads, so a setting kept in `server.cfg` still wins on every start, as before (and is
   saved again).

Details:

- Only values that differ from the built-in default are stored. Setting a value back to its
  default removes the key.
- `<setting> default` (e.g. `ru_demo_path default`) applies the built-in default and removes the
  saved value. `ru_demo_upload_header default` and `ru_demo_upload_headers_clear` both clear all
  saved headers. `ru_warmup_message_html default` works as before and also clears the saved value.
- A rejected value (e.g. `ru_demo_path /abs/`) changes nothing and saves nothing.
- `ru_warmup_startmoney` can raise `ru_warmup_maxmoney`; both are saved then.
- `ru plugin reload match` keeps every setting in memory and does not read `state.json`.
- Saved values are plain text, like `ru_match_token`: `ru_demo_upload_url` and upload header
  values (tokens) end up in `state.json`. An empty value is stored as `""`.

### Match server settings

One value per setting, the same from every side: the console / RCON (`ru_<setting> <value>`),
chat for admins (`.ru settings set <setting> <value>` and the shortcuts below) and the fleet link
(`cmd settings.set`, `server.config`). Every change is saved in `match/state.json` and applied
again after a restart; `ru_<setting> default` (or `.ru settings default <setting>`) forgets it.
`ru_<setting>` alone shows the value, where it comes from and what it does; `.settings` (anyone)
or `ru settings show` lists them all.

| Setting | Default | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `minimum_ready_required <n>` | 0 | players a team needs READY to go live (0 = a full team: the match's `players_per_team`, else 5). Also the `.forceready` threshold. `.readyrequired <n>` |
| `playout_enabled_default 0\|1` | 0 | every round is played (no clinch; overtime blocks are played out); `mp_match_can_clinch 0`. `.playout` |
| `autoready_enabled 0\|1` | 0 | a roster player is READY as soon as they are on their team in match warmup (once per connection: `.unready` sticks) |
| `knife_enabled_default 0\|1` | 1 | knife round for scrims and for match maps the config gives no side (never under the valve ruleset). `.roundknife` |
| `reset_cvars_on_series_end 0\|1` | 1 | after a series (or `ru match end`): reset the warmup cvars (respawn, buy anywhere, ...) and put the match config's own `cvars{}` back to their values from before the match. 0 keeps them; team names are cleared either way |
| `use_pause_command_for_tactical_pause 0\|1` | 0 | `.pause` / `.p` call a tactical timeout instead of a technical pause (`.tech` / `.tac` stay what they are) |
| `hostname_format "<fmt>"` | empty (off) | `hostname` while a match is loaded: `{TEAM1}` `{TEAM2}` `{MATCH_ID}` `{MAP}` `{MAPNUMBER}` `{TEAM1_SCORE}` `{TEAM2_SCORE}` `{TEAM1_SERIES}` `{TEAM2_SERIES}`. The server's own hostname (seen on the console, e.g. from `server.cfg`) comes back when the match unloads |
| `kick_when_no_match_loaded 0\|1` | 0 | non-admins are kicked while no match is loaded (not in practice or another plugin's mode, not while a fleet match loads) |
| `whitelist_enabled_default 0\|1` | 1 | only the roster, spectators and admins may stay while a match is loaded. `.whitelist` |

`.ru settings set` also takes `series_end_kick_delay_no_demo`, `series_end_kick_delay_demo_no_upload`
and `series_end_kick_delay_demo_upload` (the console settings above).

Where a value comes from, first one set wins: the saved / runtime value, then `readyup.cfg` /
`match.cfg` (the same key without `ru_`, e.g. `playout_enabled_default=1`; the older keys
`min_players_to_ready` and `scrim_knife` are read as `minimum_ready_required` and
`knife_enabled_default`), then the default above. A match config sets its own value for one match
with `playout`, `whitelist`, `autoready`, `min_players_to_ready` and `players_per_team` (fleet:
`rules.playout`, `rules.whitelist`, `rules.ready.autoready`, `rules.ready.min_per_team`, and the team
size from the players' roles when a team has a `sub`).

Substitutes: a team is ready when `minimum_ready_required` of its roster are READY (0 = a full
team) and every connected player a full team needs is READY. A connected substitute beyond the full
team does not hold the match up (before, a roster with a substitute could never go live).

## Upgrading from Postgres

Versions before this one kept admins, settings and skins in Postgres (`readyup_db.json`). Ready Up
no longer reads either. Copy the data into the JSON files once, before or right after updating:

```bash
# reads readyup_db.json next to the core:
python3 game/csgo/readyup/tools/migrate-postgres-to-json.py --csgo game/csgo
# Postgres in a docker container (psql runs inside it):
python3 game/csgo/readyup/tools/migrate-postgres-to-json.py --csgo game/csgo --docker readyup-postgres
# preview only:
python3 game/csgo/readyup/tools/migrate-postgres-to-json.py --csgo game/csgo --dry-run
```

It only reads the database and merges into existing JSON files (existing entries win;
`--prefer-db` flips that). Restart the server (or `ru plugin reload match` / `ru plugin reload
skins`) afterwards. Then `readyup_db.json` and the Postgres container can go whenever you like.

## Dev deploys

Development builds go to a test server with `scripts/dev-deploy.sh` (see
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)); the old repo-root dev installer is gone.

## Ready Up config (`readyup.cfg`)

Location (next to the shim):

- `game/csgo/readyup/bin/linuxsteamrt64/readyup.cfg`

The installer only creates this file if it's missing; it never overwrites your edits (a changed default is written as `readyup.cfg.default`).

The core reads `debug`, `banner`, `chat_prefix`, `chat_debug`, `consume_ru_chat` and the
`status_http_*` keys. The match plugin (`match.so`) reads its keys (`welcome`, `ready_hud`,
`hud_*`, `admin_prefix`, `captain_prefix_*`, `consume_ready_chat`, `dev_bots_*`, the
[match server settings](#match-server-settings),
`knife_pick_seconds`, `idle_map_refresh_hours`, `backup_keep_hours`, `demo_keep_hours`, `warmup_money`, `warmup_weapon_cleanup`) from the same place, or from a `[match]` section of this file, or from
`game/csgo/cfg/ReadyUp/match.cfg` (later ones win). It re-reads them by itself when one of those
files changes.

### Idle map refresh

After a day or more of uptime on one map, player animations run in slow motion while the tick
rate stays fine (most likely float precision in the engine clock). A map load fixes it, so:

- Loading a match always changes map, also when the server is already on the match's first map.
- `idle_map_refresh_hours=12` (default; `0` = off): when no match is loaded, nobody is connected
  and the server has been on the same map for that many hours, Ready Up loads the same map again
  (a workshop map by its id). It logs `idle-refresh: ...` and tries again at most every 10 minutes
  if the map does not change.

### File retention

Round backups (`readyup_backup_<matchid>_map<N>_round<NN>.txt`, CS2's `mp_backup_round_file`),
resume copies (`readyup_resume_...`) and GOTV demos would otherwise pile up forever. At plugin
load and every map start the match plugin deletes, on a worker thread:

- `backup_keep_hours=72` (default; `0` = keep forever): backup / resume files in the backup dirs
  (`csgo/readyup/`, `csgo/addons/metamod/`, `csgo/`) last written more than that many hours ago.
- `demo_keep_hours=24` (default; `0` = keep forever): `.dem` files in the demo dir (`ru_demo_path`
  under the write path, and under `csgo/`) last written more than that many hours ago.

Files of the loaded match (and of the match a restarted server recovers) and the demo being
recorded are never deleted. It logs `retention: deleted N round backups (72 h) and M demos (24 h)`
when it deleted something. With a fleet link, fleet.so deletes a streamed demo itself once the
platform stored it (`[fleet] demo_keep_hours`, [FLEET.md](FLEET.md)); while a streamed demo is not
confirmed by the platform yet, the sweep deletes no demos at all.

### Prefix keys

- `chat_prefix`: prefix used for Ready Up chat replies (Ready Up adds one space after it).
- `admin_prefix`: prefix used for the “true” admin name prefix (Ready Up adds one space after it).

Values support readable **ChatColors tokens** (CounterStrikeSharp-style), for example:

```text
chat_prefix=<DarkRed>[Ready Up]<Default>
admin_prefix=<DarkRed>[Admin]<Default>
```

If you want to include spaces, quote the value:

```text
chat_prefix="<Green>[PUG #1]<Default>"
```

### Welcome screen

- `welcome=1` (default): the first time a player joins T or CT on a map, Ready Up shows
  them (only them) a center-screen welcome card for ~5 seconds (then the ready HUD takes
  over) with the brand header, the build version, their name, their team and the current
  Ready Up mode. Team switches later on the same map do not show it again. Set `welcome=0`
  (or env `READYUP_WELCOME=0`) to disable.
- `hud_brand=Auto Tournament` (default) and `hud_logo_url=` (default empty = no image):
  the header of the welcome card and the ready HUD is `<img src='hud_logo_url'>` (when
  set) followed by `hud_brand`. Admins can check what the CS2 client renders (font
  classes, PNG/SVG images, unicode) with `.ru hud test 1..7`; the variant is shown only to
  the admin who typed it, for ~10 seconds.
- It needs `LegacyGameEventListener` from `gamedata/engine-surface.json` (resolved and
  anchor-verified at load) and the RTTI-verified game event manager. If either is missing,
  Ready Up logs `welcome: per-client center HTML unavailable ...` once and skips it.


### Ready HUD

- `ready_hud=1` (default): during scrim warmup and match warmup every player gets a
  small center panel (only for them): `X/Y ready`, each player per side with ✔/✖
  (CT blue, T orange; your own name in bold) and a `.r` / `.ur` hint. It waits while
  the welcome screen is up, hides once the match goes live, and shows the knife
  side-pick prompt after a knife round. `ru_warmup_message_html` text (if set) is
  shown as its last line. Same `LegacyGameEventListener` requirement as the welcome screen.
- The HUD is the ready-up UI: it stays up from joining until the match goes live, so
  the periodic "type .r" chat reminders are only sent when it cannot be shown. Chat
  still announces state changes (warmup start, countdown, knife winner, LIVE).
- CS2's own warmup is never used (its WARMUP text would replace the panel): Ready Up
  emulates warmup (respawn, no round end, buy anywhere), sets `mp_warmuptime 0` /
  `mp_warmup_pausetimer 0` on map start, and ends CS2's warmup whenever the server logs
  `World triggered "Warmup_Start"` (or fires `round_announce_warmup`) while idle, in
  scrim/match warmup or in the knife round.
- Warmup can run for hours, so nothing piles up on the ground: in scrim and match warmup
  nothing drops on death (`mp_death_drop_gun/grenade/defuser/taser 0`) and there is no bomb
  (`mp_give_player_c4 0`: nobody can plant, warmup never ends a round). Both are sent with the
  warmup rules whether or not `ru_cfg_exec_enable` runs `warmup.cfg`; `idle.cfg` and
  `knife.cfg` have no bomb either, `prac.cfg` keeps it for plant practice. In idle, scrim warmup
  and match warmup a weapon with no owner for 2 seconds is removed (G-drops included, and a
  bomb handed out before warmup started once it is dropped). readyup.cfg
  `warmup_weapon_cleanup=0` turns the removal off. Going live puts CS2's defaults back
  (`live.cfg` / `esports_live.cfg`, or the plugin without cfg exec).

### Knife round

- Real matches: `map_sides: "knife"` for a map; a map with no entry in `map_sides` gets the
  knife round when `knife_enabled_default` is on (default). Scrims: `knife_enabled_default`
  (`.roundknife`; readyup.cfg `scrim_knife=` still works).
- After everyone is ready: `exec ReadyUp/knife.cfg` (+ overrides so the emulated
  warmup is undone, and `mp_logdetail 3` for the round), restart, knife round.
- Works from server log lines alone (engine events are used when they arrive):
  the round end is read from `Team "CT"|"TERRORIST" triggered "SFUI_Notice_*"`.
  `CTs_Win`/`Terrorists_Win` = that side eliminated the other. Any other end
  (time ran out, draw) is decided by players alive, then HP left (from `attacked`
  log lines), then a coin flip.
- Any player of the winning team types `.stay` / `.switch` (or `.ct` / `.t`);
  admins can use `.ru match side ...`. Window: match `knifeDecisionSeconds` (default 60),
  scrims `knife_pick_seconds` (default 60). No pick = stay. Winning side with no
  humans (bots only) = stay after 3s.
- Then `mp_swapteams` (if switching), `exec ReadyUp/live.cfg`, `mp_restartgame 1`,
  and LIVE on the next `Round_Start`.

### Reloading config

- In-game: `.ru reload` (admin-only)
- Server console: `.ru reload` (always allowed)

## MAT webhook / heartbeat

Ready Up can forward a **core subset** of MatchZy-style events to Auto Tournament.

MAT also stores the Ready Up `plugin_version` reported by heartbeat and shows it on the **Servers** page (as an `RU v...` chip).

### 1) Verify connectivity (from the game server host)

MAT exposes a reachability helper:

- `GET /api/events/test`

Example:

```bash
curl -sS https://mat.example.com/api/events/test
```

### 2) Configure auth token (Bearer)

Ready Up reuses the same token for match config loading **and** webhook posting:

```text
ru_match_token <token>
ru_match_token clear
```

### 3) Configure webhook base URL

Set a base “events” URL (no match/server identifier at the end):

```text
ru_webhook_url https://mat.example.com/api/events
ru_webhook_url clear
```

Ready Up will POST to:

- `<baseUrl>/<match_slug>` when a loaded match provides a `slug`, otherwise
- `<baseUrl>/<matchid>`

### 3.5) Configure allocator heartbeat URL

MAT uses a dedicated heartbeat endpoint to track whether a server is **configured** and **allocatable**.

Set the full heartbeat URL (including server ID in the path):

```text
ru_heartbeat_url https://mat.example.com/api/servers/<serverId>/heartbeat
ru_heartbeat_url clear
```

Ready Up will POST a **small** JSON payload about every ~5 seconds while set:

- `status`: `idle|loading|warmup|live|postgame|error`
- `ready_for_allocation`: boolean
- optional `match_slug` / `matchid`

### 4) Load match config from URL (seeds match context)

```text
ru match load <url>
```

The response can be either:

- a raw `MatchConfig` object, or
- a `MatchResponse` wrapper containing `{ id, slug, config: { ... } }`

When this succeeds, Ready Up stores:

- `matchid`
- optional `slug`
- `team1.name` / `team2.name`
- roster mapping derived from `team1.players` and `team2.players` (Steam64 string keys)
- optional spectators whitelist derived from `spectators.players`
- optional `map_sides` array used for team enforcement (`team1_ct` / `team2_ct`)

## Whitelist + team enforcement (when match loaded)

When a match is loaded (match context exists), Ready Up enables **whitelist mode**
(`whitelist_enabled_default`, default on; a match config's `whitelist: false` turns it off for
that match):

- **Whitelist**: only SteamIDs present in `team1.players`, `team2.players`, or `spectators.players` are allowed to stay connected. Others are kicked shortly after they appear in server identity tracking.
- **Admins**: server admins are never kicked by whitelist enforcement (even if not in the match roster).
- **Team enforcement**: Ready Up forces `jointeam` so roster players can only join their allowed team.
  - Mapping uses `map_sides[map_number-1]` when present:
    - `team1_ct` ⇒ team1=CT, team2=T
    - `team2_ct` ⇒ team1=T, team2=CT
  - If `map_sides` is missing/unknown, Ready Up defaults to **team1=CT**.

## Practice + custom warmup (no built-in CS2 warmup)

Ready Up maintains its own lightweight mode state machine and can display a **non-interactive CenterHtml banner** to players.

### Commands

- **Player commands (in-game chat)**:
  - `.r` (toggle ready/unready)
  - `.ready`
  - `.unready` / `.ur`
  - `.pause` / `.p`
  - `.unpause` / `.up` (requires both teams)
  - `.gg`
  - `.ff` / `.forfeit` (captain-only; captains come from match config)
- **Mode control (server console / RCON)**:
  - `ru mode show` (prints current mode)
  - `ru mode idle`
  - `ru mode practice`
- **Admin match controls (server console / RCON)**:
  - `ru match start [force]` (force start live rules regardless of ready; `force` also without GOTV under the valve ruleset)
  - `ru match restart` (restart and return to match warmup)
  - `ru match end` (force end: emits `series_end` with winner=none, clears match context, resets server)
  - the full list (`.ru map change|reload|restart`, ...) is in [ADMINS.md](ADMINS.md#commands);
    every one also works in chat as `.ru ...` for admins
- **Match ready-up gate (server console / RCON)**:
  - `ru_warmup_enable 0|1` (default `1`). Despite the name this is more than the banner:
    - `1`: a loaded match waits in `match_warmup` until every roster player is ready, then
      plays the knife round (if `map_sides` says so) and goes live.
    - `0`: a loaded match skips ready-up entirely. No warmup rules, no ready panel or banner,
      no knife round; Ready Up goes `match_live` on the next round start. Use it only when something else starts the match.
    - Scrims (no match loaded) are not affected.
- **Warmup banner settings (server console / RCON)**:
  - `ru_warmup_message_html <html...>`
    - token expansion: `{ready_count}` / `{connected_count}` / `{total_count}`
  - `ru_warmup_message_html default` (restore default message)
  - `ru_warmup_respawn 0|1` (toggles `mp_respawn_on_death_ct/t`)
  - `ru_warmup_ignore_win_conditions 0|1` (toggles `mp_ignore_round_win_conditions`)
  - `ru_warmup_roundtime_minutes <1..120>` (sets `mp_roundtime*`)
  - `ru_warmup_startmoney <0..60000>` (sets `mp_startmoney`)
  - `ru_warmup_maxmoney <0..60000>` (sets `mp_maxmoney`)
  - `ru_warmup_buy_anywhere 0|1` (toggles `mp_buy_anywhere`)
  - `ru_warmup_infinite_ammo 0|1` (toggles `sv_infinite_ammo`)
    - `1` sets `sv_infinite_ammo 2` (infinite ammo with reload)
- **Mode cfg exec (optional, MatchZy-style)**:
  - `ru_cfg_exec_enable 0|1`
  - When enabled, Ready Up will:
    - `exec ReadyUp/warmup.cfg` when applying warmup rules
    - `exec ReadyUp/live.cfg` when applying live rules
    - `exec ReadyUp/prac.cfg` when applying practice rules
    - `exec ReadyUp/knife.cfg` when applying knife-only rules
    - `exec ReadyUp/idle.cfg` once when entering idle mode
  - Templates live in this repo at `cfg/ReadyUp/` and should be copied to your server at `game/csgo/cfg/ReadyUp/`

### Behavior

- When `ru match load` succeeds, Ready Up enters **match_warmup** and begins showing a CenterHtml banner to roster players who are **not ready** (with `ru_warmup_enable 0` there is no ready-up: see above).
- When the first `round_started` is observed in logs, Ready Up transitions to **match_live**.

### MAT integration

If you run Auto Tournament, you typically don’t set these manually. MAT can push them live via RCON:

- `POST /api/rcon/readyup/mode`
- `POST /api/rcon/readyup/practice`
- `POST /api/rcon/readyup/idle`
- `POST /api/rcon/readyup/settings`

### Events sent (core)

- Allocator heartbeat: `POST` to `ru_heartbeat_url` every ~5s (when configured)
- `series_start` (after `ru match load` parses match context)
- `match_paused` / `unpause_requested` / `match_unpaused`
- `match_forfeit` (captain-only)
- `admin_called` (`.admin [message]`, any player; also in scrims with `matchid: -1`, see docs/ADMINS.md)
- `round_end` and `map_result` in the Auto Tournament shape: `winner: {side, team}`, `team1` /
  `team2` objects (`id`, `name`, `series_score`, `score`, `score_ct`, `score_t`, `players[]`) with
  every player's stats (kills, deaths, assists, flash assists, damage, utility damage, flashes,
  1k–5k, 1v1–1v5 clutches, first kills/deaths, trades, KAST %, MVPs, score, ...), `round_time` in
  ms since the freeze time ended. `map_result` carries the map's final stats.
- `demo_recording_start` / `demo_recording_stop`, `demo_upload_start`, `demo_upload_success` /
  `demo_upload_fail`, then `demo_upload_ended` (`success`): the platform frees the server once the
  last demo upload ended. The upload itself (`ru_demo_upload_url`) carries the
  `Auto-Tournament-FileName` / `-MatchId` / `-MapNumber` / `-RoundNumber` headers (and `Get5-*`), plus
  `ru_demo_upload_header_key` / `_value` (the platform sends `X-Auto-Tournament-Token`).
- Best-effort from server console logs:
  - `player_connect`
  - `player_disconnect`
  - `round_started`
  - `round_end` (kills / deaths only, when engine game events are not available)
  - `map_result` (on map load log lines)
  - `series_end` (when a different match is loaded)

## How loading works (high level)

Ready Up is a `libserver.so` bootstrap:
- CS2 loads Ready Up first because `gameinfo.gi` includes `Game csgo/readyup`
- Ready Up loads Valve’s real server module `game/csgo/bin/linuxsteamrt64/libserver.so`
- Ready Up forwards exports and installs optional hooks (chat routing, admin prefix, etc.)

## Override the real Valve module path

If you need to force a specific real server binary:

```bash
READYUP_REAL_SERVER_PATH=/full/path/to/libserver.so
```

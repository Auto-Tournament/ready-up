// ru_api 1.13: player_change_team, player_teleport, entity_create, entity_spawn and
// engine_feature_available.
//
// Like grenade_spawn (grenades.h), the engine functions come from the practice gamedata fragment
// (gamedata/engine-surface.practice.json), which ships only with the practice plugin:
//   change_team    CCSPlayerController::ChangeTeam   (vtable slot checked on every controller)
//   teleport       CCSPlayerPawn::Teleport           (vtable slot checked on every pawn)
//   entity_create  UTIL_CreateEntityByName + CBaseEntity::DispatchSpawn
// Each must match exactly once and pass its anchors; the virtuals must also sit in their vtable
// slot and the object's vptr must be that vtable. Otherwise the feature is unavailable and nothing
// is called. Game thread only. The pure request checks are in practice_engine_spec.h.

// The live pawn of `slot`: new origin / view angles (pitch, yaw, roll) / velocity; a null part is
// left alone.

// A new entity of `classname`, not spawned yet (write its fields, then Spawn it).
void* Create(const char* classname, std::string* why);
// DispatchSpawn for an entity made by Create (its handle must round-trip).
bool Spawn(void* entity, std::string* why);

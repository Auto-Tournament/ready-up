/*
 * readyup.fleet.v1: the interface the fleet plugin (plugins/fleet, fleet.so, docs/FLEET.md)
 * publishes with
 *
 *   api->provide_interface(api->self, RU_FLEET_IFACE_NAME, RU_FLEET_IFACE_VERSION, &iface);
 *
 * Two kinds of readers:
 *   - the core, for the local status endpoint (docs/FLEET.md §17, `platform` in /status). It
 *     looks it up on the game thread whenever it rebuilds the status snapshot (a few times a
 *     second) and only uses get_status. Without the interface, or when get_status returns 0
 *     (fleet.so loaded but no [fleet] url: standalone), it reports `platform: {mode: "standalone"}`.
 *   - other plugins (match, skins), through api->get_interface(). Look it up again in every
 *     callback (fleet.so can be reloaded) and check struct_size before touching a member
 *     after get_status: offsetof(ru_fleet_v1, member) + sizeof(member) <= iface->struct_size.
 *
 * Same ABI rules as plugin_api.h: plain C, members are only ever appended, every struct
 * starts with struct_size and readers check it before touching trailing members.
 * Nothing here blocks. get_status and the members marked "any thread" are thread-safe; the
 * rest are game thread only.
 *
 * Handlers: register_handler(type, fn, user) delivers platform messages of `type` ("*" = every
 * type) on the game thread. A plugin that registers handlers MUST unregister them in its
 * readyup_plugin_unload (fleet.so cannot see other plugins unload). When fleet.so itself
 * reloads every registration is gone: compare instance_id() in your callbacks and register
 * again when it changes. Reliable messages are acked to the platform after the handlers ran.
 *
 * Local pseudo-messages (never on the wire) reach handlers the same way:
 *   "local.connection"      {"state":"online"|"offline"|"rejected"|..., "since":<unix ms>}
 *   "local.offline_timeout" {"offline_s":<n>, "threshold_s":<n>}  once per offline period (D12)

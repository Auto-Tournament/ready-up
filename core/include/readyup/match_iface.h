 * readyup.match.v1: what the match plugin (plugins/match, match.so) tells the core's local
 * status endpoint (docs/FLEET.md §17: /status, /stream, /metrics). The plugin publishes it with
 *
 *   api->provide_interface(api->self, RU_MATCH_IFACE_NAME, RU_MATCH_IFACE_VERSION, &iface);
 *
 * and the core looks it up on the game thread whenever it rebuilds the status snapshot (a few
 * times a second). Without it (no match.so, or it is being reloaded) /status reports
 * `summary.match_plugin: "none"`, mode/phase `idle` and `update_safe: true`.
 *
 * Same ABI rules as plugin_api.h: plain C, members are only ever appended, every struct starts
 * with struct_size and readers check it before touching trailing members. Game thread only;
 * must not block.
